Introduction This Project is created for a module in college called Data representation and querying. The project requires us to create a single page application. We had to use the M.E.A.N stack to create this application. For my project I wanted to create a easy to use Music website. 


###Creating the website

To create this project i used jquery, javascript, html, bootstrap cdn. 
I installed express, body-parser, path, and bootstrap.(didnt need to use local bootstrap in the end).
## Problems
I had allot of problems creating this site and had bigger hopes of what the site should do.
I have learned allot though and will use what i have learned moving forward.
